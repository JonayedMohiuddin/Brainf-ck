# Brainf-ck
This is a `BRAINF-CK LANGUAGE INTERPRETER` written on c++.Brainfuck is a minimalist language made by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993 just for fun and challenging coders.

## SYNTAX
BRAINF-CK LANGUAGE has `EIGHT SYMBOLS` in total:

| SYMBOL | ACTION        |
|:------:|:--------------:| 
| `>`  | Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
| `<`    | Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
| `+`    | Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.
| `-`    | Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.
| `.`    | Output the byte data pointer pointing at
| `,`    | Accept one byte of input, Store its value in the pointing byte.
| `[`    | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
| `]`    | If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.

# Output Mode
The default output mode of this interpreter is __Memory Format__. In memory format output is printed as follows:
```MEM[12] = 65```
You can change the output mode via a directive using $.Put $ and write the mode name after it. Only writting first letter of the mode also works. All output modes supported yet are 
| Output Type   | Command        | Demo Output  |
| :------------ |:-------------- | :-----------:|
| MEMORY TYPE*  | $M or $MEMORY  | MEM[2] = 65  |
| DECIMAL       | $D or $DECIMAL |      65      |
| ASCII         | $A or $ASCII   |       A      |

\* - is the default output mod
