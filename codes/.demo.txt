Hi! I am Jonayed. This is output of an brainfuck code. 
Of course! it is not hand written(I dont have that much patience).
This is possible by a function written in C++ which converts a print statement into brainf**k code. 
But it can't create an efficient code as, it can't leave a memory foot print behind.
Because it can cause problem in latter brainfuck codes. So the method keeps the memory clean :).
* This string to brainfuck tanspiler can be even better and efficient.
* So if you have any advice please contact me : jonayedmohiuddin@gmail.com
